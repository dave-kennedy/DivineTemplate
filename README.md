### What is the Divine Template?

The Divine Template is a fluid, responsive CSS template based on the [Divine Grid](http://www.github.com/davidkennedy85/DivineGrid).

It comes bundled with [jquery.toggleme](http://www.github.com/davidkennedy85/jquery.toggleme), which is not necessary to use the template, but is cool nonetheless.
